# pandas-practice

A playground to learn/refresh my pandas skills.
I started with looking at real data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
The program takes a country as an argument and creates 3 charts: absolute, velocity and acceleration.
Then it creates a web page that displays these 3 charts.
